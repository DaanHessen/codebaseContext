## Core Scenarios

### 1. Full Context Generation

"As a full-stack developer, I need to generate a complete codebase snapshot excluding sensitive files, so I can safely share project context with my AI coding assistant."

### 2. Selective Sharing

"As a mobile developer working on a feature branch, I want to select specific files to include in my context package, so I can get targeted assistance without exposing unrelated code."

### 3. Team Onboarding

"As a tech lead, I need to generate comprehensive codebase overviews with file structure visualization, so I can quickly bring new team members up to speed."

### 4. Debugging Support

"As a junior developer, I want to share relevant code sections with my AI pair programmer, so I can get help debugging without sharing the entire codebase."

### 5. Context Maintenance

"As an AI power user, I want to update my AI assistant with only changed code sections, so I can maintain context without resending the entire codebase.
